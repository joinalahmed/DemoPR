## Steps

**Note:** _If you have never used Git or GitHub, it is highly recommended to read the articles mentioned in the **Reading Material** section._

1. Fork this repository 
2. Clone your repository locally
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<username>/DemoPR
   ```
3. Write your username and your favourite author as given below in the `README.md` file. Add three spaces before each of the links you add so it comes under your name.(The three spaces represented by the dot `â‹…` here)
   ```md
   - [<username>](https://github.com/username)
   â‹…â‹…â‹…- Blog Link
   â‹…â‹…â‹…- Twitter Link
   â‹…â‹…â‹…- LinkedIn Link
   â‹…â‹…â‹…- [OPTIONAL] Dribble/CodePen/Stack Overflow or any other web presence
   ```
4. Add the file to the staging area
   ```sh
   git add README.md
   ```
5. Commit your file
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Add name - <username>"
   ```
   
   If you see a warning like this, you most probably have not configured git correctly. ðŸ˜ž
   ```
   *** Please tell me who you are.

   Run

   git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"

   to set your account's default identity.
   ```
   If you see this warning, you're suggested to go through the **Reading Material**, if you have not already, as this step is given in Part 1! Anyways, as given in the warning, you need to run the two commands
   ```sh
   git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   ```
   
   
6. Push your changes to your repository
   ```sh
   git push origin master
   ```
7. Check the changes are reflected in your repository - `https://github.com/<username>/DemoPR`
8. Create a Pull Request on the original repo([https://github.com/mbtamuli/DemoPR/](https://github.com/mbtamuli/DemoPR/)) ðŸš€
9. Do **Star** this repo! ðŸ˜ƒ
